# Portfolio

#This is my portfolio where I show some programs made by me in different types of programming languages.


#In Life_Expetancy_and_GDP directory, I create a program to analyze and visualize data of several countries, namely GDP and life expetancy, with python and some packages life numpy and matplotlib. 

#In "email_sender" directory, I developed as my first project with django a website to send emails to my gmail account. I tested and it works but due to gmail security, I remove my account and password from settings.py and that led to the sending of email not working anymore.

#In "underground" project, I am creating a website to visualize the differents metro lines and stations from Porto.(under development)

#The tic-tac-toe project is being developed using pygame library as my first project with this library
